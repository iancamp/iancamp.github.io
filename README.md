# Ian Campbell — Static Personal Site

A fun, colorful, single-page site built with plain HTML/CSS/JS — ready for GitHub Pages.

## Quick Start (Local)
Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a new public repo named `USERNAME.github.io` (replace USERNAME).
2. Add these files to the repo root:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `script.js`
   - `assets/photos/*`
3. Commit & push.
4. In the repo Settings → Pages, ensure "Branch: main / root" is selected (or just use the default for `USERNAME.github.io` repos).
5. Visit `https://USERNAME.github.io/`

## Customize
- Replace SVG placeholders in `assets/photos/` with your own images (JPG/PNG). Keep filenames if you want to avoid editing code, or update `window.IAN_SITE_PHOTOS` in `index.html`.
- Update the email in the Connect section.
- Tweak colors and spacing in `styles.css`.
- Add more sections by following the existing structure and styles.

## Notes
- This site uses no frameworks, so it's fast and free to host.
- Lightbox and filters are powered by tiny vanilla JS in `script.js`.
